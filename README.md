# Alex Fitz Programming Examples

Located in my repository are two folders. Located in this folder (coding examples) is programming projects broken down by programming language to demonstrate my proficiency in a variety of languages. Additionally, the [bioinformatics](../Bioinformatics) folder contains a variety of bioinformatics oriented projects I have completed. [DGE-Analysis](https://github.com/afitz-gmu/DGE-Analysis) is a package that I developed to assist researchers in differential gene expression analysis in R. Lastly, analyzing NCI-60 data in R I have completed an [analysis](https://rpubs.com/afitz/751586) to determine specific genes across multiple cancer types.
